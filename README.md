## Codebase

1. `src`: Folder containing scripts

    - `GettingStarted.ipynb`: My all-in-one notebook for a brief EDA and prediction visualization.
    - `make_aoi_samples.py`: Script to make samples for experiments from the CalCrop21 benchmark. Step 1 of 3.
    - `grid_search.py`: Script for grid search over all experimental parameters. Step 2 of 3.
    - `ResultsViz.ipynb`: Notebook to visualize results of grid search. Step 3 of 3.
    - `utils.py`: Useful plotting and other utils.
    - `unsuable_tiles.txt`: This are the tiles from Calcrop21 that are deemed not suitable for this analysis after the max NDVI RGB extraction.
    - `colormap.py`: A colormap for the CDL.

2. `cached_models`: Folder to save SAM weights

3. `results`: Folder to store results
